# Moderation Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
Warn players using the :warn \[user] \[reason] command!
{% endhint %}

#### Trolling

1. Tell them to stop or they will get warned.
2. If they continue warn them. If they continue after the warning warn them again.
3. Once you have warned them 3 times, serverban them.

#### Exploiting

Gather evidence and permban them instantly (depending on your rank you might only be able to serverban them).&#x20;
