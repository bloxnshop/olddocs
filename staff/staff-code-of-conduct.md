Communication


The definition of communication is using the Roblox chatbox or voice chat. You must use proper grammar and communicate with customers in English, except when in team chat.

Uniform Policy


You must wear the uniform during on duty, any clothing that covers the majority of the staff uniform is not permitted.

Operational Duties


You must not be idle or tabbed out while keeping your lane open. If you need to attend to other matters, please close and log off your current lane.

Customer Interaction


Respect for customers is mandatory at all times. You must address every customer concern, utilizing tools such as Google Translate if necessary.

Employee Area Protocol


Ensure that the doors to employee-only areas are fully closed before leaving.

## Disruptive Behaviour

You are prohibited from using any means to disrupt the operation of store machines or to disturb customers and staff. This includes interrupting a shift briefing or training session unless you have been given permission to speak.

## Warning Policy

All staff members have the authority to warn customers who violate the game moderation rules. It is essential to adhere to the Moderation Guide to issue a warning or a server ban (for Management+ only). If you issue a warning or a ban to a customer without a clear reason, or if it is done intentionally, you may receive a warning or face being blacklisted, depending on the severity of the action.

***

Violators will be issued a formal warning and can be fired once they reach **3 warnings**. If they continue to get fired, they may face a **blacklist** from the rank centre and application centre if the violation is serious.
