# 2 | Moderation Guide

## Game Moderation

Moderation in [any of our games on Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/communities/33854030/BloxNShop-Limited#!/about).

### Definitions

* **Informal warning:** Notify the user to stop their behavior, or they will receive a formal warning.
* **Formal warning:** Warning with the `:warn [user] [reason]` command in Roblox.

All staff members (Trainee Store Colleague above), have the authority to issue warnings to customers who violate the game moderation rules. Only Management or above have the authority to server ban a user after they have received three warnings.

If a user receives three warnings and there are **no management members or above on duty**, please request assistance in the [#staff-assistance](https://discord.com/channels/1188319939719856209/1283071327745609831) channel.

In the Training Centre, only the host and trainers are permitted to moderate.
