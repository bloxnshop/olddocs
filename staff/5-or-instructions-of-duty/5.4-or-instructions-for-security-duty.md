## Definition of Thief

When customers leave the store and the EAS Gate sounds or VOCOVO indicates "Zone: 1 | Alarm," and the customer's nametag shows "STEALING," they are considered to be a thief.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Cuff the Thief

When you identify a thief, equip your handcuff and cuff them by pressing **"C"**. Bring them back to the cashier **self-service checkout area** and uncuff them by pressing **"C"** again.\
You **must inform** the stealers that they need to **pay before leaving the store**.\
If necessary, specify the number of products they stole using the [Inventory Search Tool](5.4-or-instructions-for-security-duty.md#instructions-for-using-the-inventory-search-tool). If they are using a basket or trolley, instruct them to unload the items for payment.

For more information on moderation, please refer to [2 | Moderation Guide](../moderation-guide.md).
