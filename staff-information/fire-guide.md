# Fire Guide

When you notice a fire in the store, please report it to a management in game or report it in ‚Å†[#staff-assistance](https://discord.com/channels/1188319939719856209/1283071327745609831) if there is nobody available. Then activate the fire alarm. After all of this you will have to follow the procedure:

1. Close every self checkouts and manual checkouts.&#x20;
2. Evacuate everyone.&#x20;
3. Check if there is anyone at the toilets, if yes ask them to evacuate.&#x20;
4. Do a little tour and make sure there is nobody.

After you have done all of this, please go outside and join management+. If you notice a fire and don't report it, punishments might be given as it's dangerous for our customers. And if you are not following the procedure, punishment will be given. **If it is getting dangerous inside stop the procedure and head outside immidiatly to wait for the fire department.**
