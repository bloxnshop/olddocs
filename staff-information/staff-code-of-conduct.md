# 1 | Staff Code of Conduct

The following Code of Conduct is only eligible to on-duty staff members. Only users ranked **Trainee Store Colleague+** are considered staff members. Anyone ranked below must either [purchase an higher rank](https://www.roblox.com/games/85187706204057) or [pass the staff application](https://www.roblox.com/games/18842770808/BECOME-STAFF-BloxNShop-Application-Center).

* You must not use any forms that may cover the majority of the staff uniform.&#x20;
* You must communicate with customers in English and use proper grammar while doing so, except when in team chat.&#x20;
* You must not be idle or tabbed out while having your lane kept open. If you wish to deal with other matters, please close the lane that you are currently operating.&#x20;
* You must not disrespect the customers at all times and must respond to every concern of them, whether it be through the use of Google Translate or any other communication tools.&#x20;
* You must ensure that the doors of the employee-only areas are completely closed before walking away.

Violators will be issued a formal warning and can be fired once they reach **3 warnings**. If they continue to get fired they may face a blacklist from the rank centre and application centre if the violation is serious.
